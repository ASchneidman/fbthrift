# Style Guide

## Metadata

All spec files should start with metadata about the page. The metadata must include:

- `state`: The current state of the page. Must be one of `draft`, `reviewing`, or `published`.
- `created`: The date the page was first created in `mm-dd-yyyy` format.
- `updated`: The date the page was last updated in `mm-dd-yyyy` format.

For example:

```yaml
state: draft
created: 07-18-2022
updated: 07-18-2022
```
